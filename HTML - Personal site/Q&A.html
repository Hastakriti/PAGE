    <h2>Questionnaire</h2><hr>
    <h1></h1>
    <h4><strong>  Q.From where did you get the idea of starting this page?</strong><br>
       Means are you inspired by someone to start it or you have to start something your own? What's the main reason behind it? </h4>
    <h5><i> Ans: Actually I worked as a reseller for approx two years, where I have to sell the products of other sellers <br>
    Like Clothes, Footwear, Accesories and all. And one day I realise that, I can also made many of these products by my own, then i asked a question to myself. <br>
 Why shouldn't I am making my own products and then selling them ? It benefits me in many ways like first of all My skills will <br>
 Improve and also when I sell them I need not to depend on anyone for financial help. And also it comes under the <br>
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's Scheme of "Support Local" and avoid investing on foreign products. So all these thoughts <br>
inspires me a lot to open Hastakriti.</i></h5>
<h4><strong>Q. As we can see in starting of the page you structured your page with the Jewellery items but after the gap of approx <br>
10-11 months you started with almost different type of products like wooden wall hangings. WHY? </strong></h4>
<h5><i>Ans: In that gap I realised that I will work on all different types of materials and explore each material one by one. <br>
I will also made jewelleries with these materials, because in that time of break I came thorugh a lot and also I realised that <br>
I am not made for only thing, then why should I only limited to jewellery items? I want to work on every type of materials and <br>
also I don't want to put myself into any type of limits. </i></h5>
<h4><strong>Q. Then What is Hastakriti for? Which specialization did your followers are looking for in that page?</strong></h4>
<h5><i>Ans: I have no particular answer of this question right now but I think you will get the answer with the time and <br>
also with the work like jo bhi maine soch rakha hai jaisa bhi. Dekhte haiðŸ˜Š</i></h5>
<h4><strong>Q. Okay leave it! Now tell me Why there is so much gap between your Graduation and PG?</strong></h4>
<h5><i>Ans: That gap was not expected, I was supposed to do designing for what I was preparing for but at the last moment <br>
My Parents changed their opinion so I had to left designing... na chahte hue bhi. Ahh! Four years I didn't expect <br>
that I am coming back to do PG with M.A.</i></h5>
<h4><strong>Q. Preparation? What type of Preparation?</strong></h4>
<h5><i>Ans: Preparation of Entrance exam for designing colleges.</i></h5>
<h4><strong>Q. And what's the result?</strong></h4>
<h5><i>Ans: That was not satisfying and I couldn't get admission after preparing for three years. You can also say it's a bad luck.</i></h5>
